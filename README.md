# Project-2-Music-Genre-Identification

# Music Genre Classification with Optimized CNN

## Project Overview

This repository contains an end-to-end pipeline for music genre classification using an optimized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The project utilizes the GTZAN dataset (10 genres, 1000 audio tracks) and leverages advanced audio feature extraction and deep learning techniques to classify genres from audio files.

## Hardware Constraints

> **Note:**  
> The performance of this model was also limited by the available GPU VRAM. Due to VRAM constraints, batch size and model complexity had to be reduced, which impacted both training speed and achievable accuracy. Larger batch sizes or deeper models could not be used without causing out-of-memory errors, a common bottleneck in deep learning workflows on consumer GPUs[2][3][5].

## Notable Techniques

- **Feature Fusion:** Combines mel-spectrogram, MFCC, chroma, and spectral contrast for richer input.
- **Data Normalization & Padding:** Ensures consistent input shapes.
- **Class Weighting:** Handles class imbalance.
- **Regularization:** Dropout and BatchNorm reduce overfitting.
- **Early Stopping & LR Scheduling:** Prevents overfitting and accelerates convergence.
